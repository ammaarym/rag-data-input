# ðŸ§  RAG Chatbot with Multi-Platform Integrations & Permission Control

This project is a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by **LlamaIndex**, built to ingest, query, and respond using real-time data from multiple third-party platforms â€” all while enforcing fine-grained user permissions.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Python
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- Parato (custom app framework for orchestration)
- FastAPI (optional layer for API serving)
- Paragon (for workflow automation)

**Integrations:**
- Google Drive API
- Slack API
- Notion API
- Dropbox API
- Okta FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization)

**Data Pipeline & Infra:**
- Webhooks & Polling for sync
- Paragon Paragraph templates
- Real-time permission syncing
- RAG architecture with embedding + vector store (e.g., FAISS or Weaviate)

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ”— Multi-Platform Integration (Part 1)
Parato automatically ingests and syncs data from:
- **Google Drive:** including live permission data
- **Slack:** channel messages, threads, file links
- **Notion:** structured pages, blocks, and databases

The system uses LlamaIndex to embed and index this data, allowing the chatbot to respond with up-to-date and relevant context from all connected platforms.

### ðŸ”’ Fine-Grained Permissions (Part 2)
Responses are restricted to only the data the querying user has access to:
- Google Drive and Dropbox permission trees are parsed and indexed
- Okta FGA manages unified user access across all platforms
- Access control is enforced at **query time**, in real-time

---

## ðŸ“š Use Cases

- Secure AI knowledge assistants for enterprise teams
- Contextual search/chat over multi-platform company data
- Permission-aware internal tools for HR, Legal, or IT

---

## ðŸ§ª Status

Actively under development. This repo is focused on core functionality for ingestion and permission control, with more advanced RAG routing and agentic behavior planned for the future.
